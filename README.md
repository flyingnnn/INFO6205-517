Team #517: Nenghui Fang, Yuchen He

Our project goal is to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem using genetic algorithm. In this project, four classes have been created, which are City class, Individual class, Population class and TSP class. The City class is used for initializing the location of each city representing by their coordinate. The Individual class contains the method of calculating and updating. It also including gene expression which it is named as route, standing for the tour between cities. The Population class is the most essential in this program, it has all the other aspects of GA, which are population, selection, crossover and mutation. It also has a sort function for sorting the best route, an evolution function and a logging function. Lastly, the TSP class is the main class, it involves all the GA parameters holds all the elements, and prints out the consequences.
